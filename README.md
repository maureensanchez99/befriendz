# befriendz
==================
This project was built as a submission for Hackthrob 2021. Entered in the categories Most Heartfelt Hack and Best Domain Name

## What this project does
The purpose of this website is for people to post activities they want to do with someone, whether as a pair of friends or even a gathering. Since a majority of the world is still under lockdown, people can choose to meet virtually or have socially distanced meet ups depending on what current safety guidelines are going on their areas. 
## How this was built
First I used Figma to design what I envisioned the site to look like. After that in Visual Studio Code, I created the html and css files necessary to build this site.  
## What is next for this project
I hope to be able to convert this site into mobile app once I learn more of the basics for 
creating apps.
